- search for multi-conformer continuum electrostatics on google
- go to mcce website and download version 2.2
- cd to mcce-2.2 directory
- comment out line that says "checkGLIB" in mcce_install
- run ./mcce_install
- accept default install directory and add /usr/local/mcce/bin to your PATH or create a softlink with some other directory in your path.  If you change the PATH make sure to run source.
- for OS X on intel machines copy the mcce and delphi executables from this installation directory to /usr/local/mcce/bin and make sure that they are executable (use chmod +x if necessary)
  - this step shouldn't be necessary on other platforms, but we haven't tried it yet
- add the following line to your bash_profile and run source .bash_profile
   export MCCE_LOCATION="/usr/local/mcce"

Note that you may have to chance some paths in the prm files to run the example.
